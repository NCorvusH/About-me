<p>Hello, I'm Norbert Harrow, also known as Corvus. I've been working as an artist since 2012, with a deep passion for Concept Art. My expertise lies in Fantasy and Medieval aesthetics, but I'm quick to adapt to new settings and themes. I thrive on brainstorming and generating ideas straight from my imagination, though I always ensure accuracy by referencing when needed.
<br>
  <br>
I am currently in my final year of a Masterâ€™s Degree in Game Design and Programming (Unity and Unreal Engine), where I am developing a functional game demo as my final project. My journey into the world of game development has been incredibly rewarding, and I aim to continue expanding my skills in 3D Modelling and beyond.
<br>
  <br>
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also studying a Backend Development course with DevOps, enhancing my programming capabilities. I currently work as a digital media illustrator, where my attention to detail and problem-solving skills shine.
<br>
  <br>
Originally from the Scottish Highlands, I now reside in Huelva, Spain. I'm a resolute and hard-working individual, driven by my motto: "I am not phenomenally skilled, but phenomenally willed," which has been a guiding light through challenging times.
<br>
  <br>
I am eager to join the industry to learn from and collaborate with fellow professionals, with a particular interest in becoming a backend developer. If you're looking for a dedicated and adaptable developer, let's connect!</p>
<br>
<b>Languages:</b> English (Native), Norwegian, Japanese (N4) and Spanish (C2).
<br>
<b>Hobbies:</b> 3D Modelling/Sculpting, Drawing, Writing, Playing piano,
